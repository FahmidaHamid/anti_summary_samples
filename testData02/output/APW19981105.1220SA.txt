summary: 

 Surveyors have yet to evaluate roughly 10 percent of the most affected areas _ the departments of Cortes, Atlantida, Colon and Yoro in the north, southern Choluteca and Valle, and the central department of Francisco Morazan, which includes the capital. Mitch damaged or destroyed at least 90 bridges on major highways, including most spans on Highway 5, the main north-south route, officials said. ``We have to vaccinate the children,'' said Dr. Mario Soto, who has treated at least 300 children at the shelter for diarrhea, conjunctivitis and bacterial infections.

 A total of 14 helicopter relief missions were delivering aid to stricken towns, said Col. Roger Antonio Caceres of the government's Operation Mitch emergency response task force. It also was pulling food from warehouses at its base in Rome, probably for delivery by emergency relief flights, spokesman Trevor Rowe said. ``We're trying to move food as fast as possible to help people as soon as possible,'' Rowe said.
