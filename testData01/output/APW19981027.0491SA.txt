summary: 

 Cambodia's ruling party responded Tuesday to criticisms of its leader in the U.S. Congress with a lengthy defense of strongman Hun Sen's human rights record. Ranariddh and his core supporters did not return to Cambodia until a few months before an election in July this year that the ruling party narrowly won. ``They must not make unjust accusations against those who led the struggle to liberate the people from genocide,'' it added.

 ``The CPP would like to launch an appeal to U.S. senators to wisely and realistically consider this draft resolution and give justice to the CPP, Hun Sen and the Cambodian people by not approving it,'' the party said in a statement. U.N. human rights workers later discovered more than 20 bodies _ many bearing signs of torture _ in and around the capital, prompting speculation that the death toll could be much higher. The ruling party supported the police action in its statement, noting that public property was damaged by protesters and that grenades were thrown at Hun Sen's home after Sam Rainsy suggested in a speech that the U.S. government should fire cruise missiles at Hun Sen.
